#LUCENZjava
This software helps to simulate enzyme kinetics, through a GUI interface. It takes input data either entered manually or loaded from a formatted file, runs it through a series of equations and regression, and outputs the simulated results with numbers and graphs. LUCENZjava is a port from the original LUCENZ which was written in Visual Basic. The port was neccessary so the software can be run on multiple operating systems.

##Who's it for? 
LUCENZjava has been developed by Victoria University of Wellington students for Victoria University of Wellington students. LUCENZjava has two versions, 200 and 300. These versions are meant for the corresponding levels of university biology courses.

##Deployment
LUCENZjava uses a third-party program (install4j) to build .dmg and .exe applications so it can be run easily by students. Install4j has not been set up to automatically run from build commands.

##Final words 
LUCENZjava was built with a set scope and time period. This code is freely available but the original LUCENZjava team is no longer responsible for maintaining it. Have a great day.
